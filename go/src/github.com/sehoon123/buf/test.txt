NOTE: The accepted answer was correct in early versions of Go. See the highest voted answer contains the more recent idiomatic way to achieve this.

There is function ReadLine in package bufio.

Please note that if the line does not fit into the read buffer, the function will return an incomplete line. If you want to always read a whole line in your program by a single call to a function, you will need to encapsulate the ReadLine function into your own function which calls ReadLine in a for-loop.

bufio.ReadString('\n') isn't fully equivalent to ReadLine because ReadString is unable to handle the case when the last line of a file does not end with the newline character.
